Twitter_Dangerous_Areas_Project
===============================

This is an illustration of the most "dangerous" areas in the United States. I encorporated the Tweepy and Basemap libraries. I took words that were associated with crimes or dangerous activities such as "stolen" or "stole" and plotted that on a map to identify areas of potential crime. For example, certain tweets would say, "My biken was just stolen." with coordinates (-96.75242, 32.989787). I took the coordinates of that user's tweet and plotted it on to a map. This is the results that I got.
